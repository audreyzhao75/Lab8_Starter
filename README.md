1) We would fit our automated tests within a github action that runs whenever code is pushed to the repository, because it will keep all the code updated. Whenever we make pushes there will be established checkpoints on when tests pass or fail so we can differentiate different errors in different locations. Manually running them locally is unreliable because teammates could either forget to test for it or incorrectly test their code. Finally, running the tests after all development is complete is a terrible idea because you may encounter dozens of errors that will make debugging extremely confusing and difficult. It is easier to test often and use unit testing to make sure all the code being pushed works properly.
2) No, because end-to-end testing is used for testing the entire program or specific user action/journey rather than focusing on a single function, which would be for unit testing. 
3) No?
4) yes?
